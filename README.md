# Sudoku Puzzle
Sudoku is an easy to learn number placement puzzle. It consists of 
81 cells which are divided into nine columns, rows and sub-grid regions. 
The purpose of the player is to place the numbers from 1 to 9 into the 
empty cells in such a way that in every row, column and 3Ã—3 region each number appears only once.

# Sudoku solver
There are three different versions of Sudoku Solvers:

  - __Sudoku_BT.py__ - solves sudoku puzzle using recursive backtracking algorithm 
  - __Sudoku_FC.py__ - solves sudoku puzzle using backtracking and forward checking
  - __Sudoku_Heuristics.py__ - Uses Heuristic ( minimum-remaining-values, least-constraining-value,
   degree heuristic) in addition to backtracking and forward checking to solve a given sudoku

# How To Run
An input file is required to run each of the sudoku solver. For example:


__input_file.txt__

```

0 1 9 2 5 4 0 7 6
2 4 3 6 7 1 8 5 9
5 7 6 8 9 3 2 4 1
3 5 0 9 6 7 1 8 0
1 8 7 3 4 5 0 9 2
9 6 4 1 0 2 0 3 5
7 2 1 4 0 9 5 6 8
4 3 8 5 2 6 9 0 7
6 9 5 7 1 8 4 0 3
